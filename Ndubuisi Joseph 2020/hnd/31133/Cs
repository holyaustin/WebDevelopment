assignment The difference between Nosql and Mysql

NoSQL databases are not so good for complex queries because these are not as powerful as SQL queries but are best suited for hierarchical large data storage.

On other hand NOSQL is purely open source and MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDB, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j, CouchDB are the main implementation of it.

while Mysql SQL databases are best suited for complex queries but are not preferred for hierarchical large data storage. SQL dbs is implemented in both open source and commercial Database such as like Postgres & MySQL as open source and Oracle and Sqlite as commercial.

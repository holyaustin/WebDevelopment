Assignment 1

The critical differences between SQL and NoSQL are:

               Structure

SQL databases are relational while NoSQL databases are non-relational.

               Mode of operation

SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.

          Data arrangement

SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

                Mode of storage

SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.

              Area of application

SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

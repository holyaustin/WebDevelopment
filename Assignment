Below are five critical differences between SQL vs NoSQL:

1. SQL databases are relational, NoSQL databases are non-relational.
2. SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
3. SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
4. SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.
5. SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

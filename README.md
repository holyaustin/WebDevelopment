The following are the main difference between SQL and NoSQL

Type –
SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database. 

 Language – 
SQL databases defines and manipulates data based structured query language (SQL). Seeing from a side this language is extremely powerful. SQL is one of the most versatile and widely-used options available which makes it a safe choice especially for great complex queries. But from other side it can be restrictive.

Scalability – 
In almost all situations SQL databases are vertically scalable. This means that you can increase the load on a single server by increasing things like RAM, CPU or SSD. But on the other hand NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. This means that you handle more traffic by sharding, or adding more servers in your NoSQL database. 

Structure – 
SQL databases are table-based on the other hand NoSQL databases are either key-value pairs, document-based, graph databases or wide-column stores. This makes relational SQL databases a better option for applications that require multi-row transactions such as an accounting system or for legacy systems that were built for a relational structure. 

 Property followed – 
SQL databases follow ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) whereas the NoSQL database follows the Brewers CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance). 

Support – 
Great support is available for all SQL database from their vendors. Also a lot of independent consultations are there who can help you with SQL database for a very large scale deployments but for some NoSQL database you still have to rely on community support and only limited outside experts are available for setting up and deploying your large scale NoSQL deployments.
 
 Key highlights point on different between SQL and NoSQL: 

1. SQL are RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDBMS) while NoSQL are Non-relational or distributed database system.
2. SQL  have fixed or static or predefined schema.	while NoSQL have dynamic schema.
3. SQL are not suited for hierarchical data storage. While NoSQL are best suited for hierarchical data storage.
4. SQL are best suited for complex queries	. While NoSQL are not so good for complex queries
5. SQL are vertically Scalable	while are Horizontally scalable
6. SQL Follows ACID property	while NoSQL Follows CAP(consistency, availability, partition tolerance)
Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS-SQL Server etc	Examples: MongoDB, GraphQL, HBase, Neo4j, Cassandra etc

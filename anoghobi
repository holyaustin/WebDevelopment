                The difference between Nosql and Mysql.

                                 Answer

NOSQL database is known as non-relational or distributed database.

NoSQL database on other hand has dynamic schema for unstructured data.Data stored in this type of database is not structured and could be stored in either of forms such as document-oriented, column-oriented, graph-based or organized as a KeyValue store. This syntax can be varied from DB to DB.

In order to increase the capacity of NOSQL dbs we required to install new servers parallel to the parent server i.e NOSQL dbs could be scalable in horizontal and this made them more preferable choice for large or ever-changing data sets.

while Mysql
SQL database is generally classified as a Relational database i.e. RDBMS.

SQL uses structured query language for its CRUD operation which is defined as SQL. 
This makes SQL database to store data in more structured form and also preferred for more complex operations which could get completed with complex SQL queries.

SQL database can extends its capacity on single server by increasing things like RAM, CPU or SSD i.e we can say that SQL dbs could be scalable in vertical as their storage could be increase for the same server by enhancing its storage components.
